## About LeetCode

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is one of the most prolific online competitve programming platforms.

You get a prompt with a programming problem based on algorithms and data structures. You get an editor where you can write your code in your language of choice. The objective is simple: Come up with a fast and efficient solution to the problem which passes all the test cases.

One thing that puts LeetCode ahead of almost every other similar platform is the availability of popular interview questions from tech giants like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc. This makes the platform an ideal place to practice for interviews at these and other companies.
